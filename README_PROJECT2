On running make the executable that is crreated is project2

To remove the object files do a make clean

Files:
deleteUtil.cpp  evalWhereConds.cpp              helper.cpp      helpSelect.cpp  project2.cpp        StorageManager.cpp
dropUtil.cpp    evalWhereConds_lastWorking.cpp  helpInsert.cpp  parserLib.cpp   selectJoinUtil.cpp 

Corresponding .h files are also present.
